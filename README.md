# Image Annotation Tool

This is a tool for annotating images with bounding boxes, aimed at creating datasets for machine learning purposes. The idea is to automate the process of object identification in images, reducing the time and effort needed for human annotation.

## Tech Stack

The tool is built using the following technologies:

- **Flask**: a web framework for building the backend
- **OpenCV**: a computer vision library for image processing and manipulation
- **JavaScript**: a programming language for building interactive web applications
- **HTML/CSS**: markup and styling languages for building web pages

In the future, the tool may also integrate deep learning models for automated object detection and annotation.

## Motivation

While there are already many image annotation tools available in the market, this tool was built as a way to gain practical experience and learn more about building web applications and computer vision projects.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork this project and add additional features, such as integrating deep learning models or expanding the user interface. I am open to collaborating with others to improve this tool and make it more useful for the machine learning community.
